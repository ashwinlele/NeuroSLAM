This work adapts the bio-inspired RatSLAM algorithm (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1307183) to Spiking neural networks (SNN) based bio-plausible implementation. The work was carried out by Dr. Jong-Hyeok Yoon at Prof. Arijit Raychowdhury's lab at Georgia Tech and is currently being maintained by Ashwin Lele - a PhD student in the same group. The details of the VCO-based SNN circuit implementation and measurements can be found in ISSCC 2021 (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9365926) and JSSC 2021 (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9509297) papers.
